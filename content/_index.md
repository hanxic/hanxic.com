I am a first-year CS Ph.D. student at Cornell University, broadly interested in programming language semantics, proofs, mechanization, and logics.

I recently graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of Pennsylvania (Go Quakers!) with an uncoordinated dual bachelor's degree between Computer Science from Engineering and Economics from Wharton, and a master's degree in Computer and Information Science. During my time at Penn, I am extremely fortunate to research in Penn PLClub under the supervision of my amazing advisor, Prof. Steve Zdancewic. I worked on the Verifying LLVM Project, linear logic, and program semantics using Rocq and OCaml. I was also a Wharton Research Scholar supervised by Prof. Sanjeev Khanna on the Knapsack problems with Precedence Constraints.
