I am a first-year CS Ph.D. student at [Cornell University](https://bowers.cornell.edu/), broadly interested in programming language semantics, proofs, mechanization, and logics.

I recently graduated Summa Cum Laude from [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) with an [uncoordinated dual bachelor's degree](https://undergrad-inside.wharton.upenn.edu/dual-degree/) between Computer Science from [Engineering](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) and Economics from [the Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/), and an accelerated master's degree in Computer and Information Science. I was extremely fortunate to research in Penn's [PLClub](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~plclub/) under the supervision of my amazing advisor, [Prof. Steve Zdancewic](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~stevez/). I worked on [Verifying LLVM](https://github.com/vellvm/vellvm), linear logic, testing, and other program semantics using Rocq and OCaml. I was also a [Wharton Research Scholar](https://undergrad-inside.wharton.upenn.edu/wrs/) supervised by [Prof. Sanjeev Khanna](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sanjeev/) on the Knapsack problems with Precedence Constraints.
