I am a first-year CS Ph.D. student at Cornell University, broadly interested in programming language semantics, proofs, mechanization, and logics.

I recently graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of Pennsylvania with an uncoordinated dual bachelor's degree between Computer Science (SEAS) and Economics (Wharton), and a master's degree in Computer and Information Science (SEAS). I am extremely fortunate to research in Penn PLClub under the supervision of my amazing advisor, Prof. Steve Zdancewic. I mainly worked on the Vellvm Project, but have also worked on other development, mainly in OCaml and Rocq. I've also done algorithms research with Prof. Sanjeev Khanna on instances of Knapsack problems with Precedence Constraints.
